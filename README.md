![One Wallet Logo](https://github.com/jsmellz/OneWalletApp/blob/master/onewalletlogo.png)

One Wallet was a fun idea I played around with after getting very frustrated with some of the tradtional banking apps. The idea was simple - one simple wallet that combined all my finances. I started with using the Plaid api to get access to user's bank accounts and dremed of one day integrating with venmo and paypal so that you could truly have just one wallet. Project is a little messy... sorry it's a workin progres.
